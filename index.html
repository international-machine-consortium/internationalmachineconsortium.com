      <p>
        For as long as we remember, mankind has been watching the sky,
        fascinated by the great infinity. We have gazed at the stars in awe,
        just trying to comprehend and figure out our place in it all. What are
        we, where do we come from, what is our purpose and maybe the most
        intriguing qestion of them all: are we alone?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some that say that we actually have the answer, that we at
        this moment actually are in contact with alien life. In the inner
        sanctum of the deep state, behind 6 levels of top secret, there is the
        International Machine Consortium - the joint forces of states that for
        the last 60 years have been on a sonically search for otherworldly life,
        shouting into the vast emptiness of space and patiently been waiting for
        a "hello". Have they gotten any answers? Well, we don't know. They are a
        bit secretive about it. Many are even questioning the very existence of
        the IMC.
      </p>

      <p>
        The swedish section however… well, they exist and they are really into
        doing noisy field work. With strange sound waves, curious signals,
        fantastic frequencies and immersive impulses they send out their message
        into the black beyond. However, the broadcasts of the IMC are not only
        for extraterrestrials to enjoy. Humans may find their cosmic
        transmissions kinda swell, and a bit mesmerizing, too. So come and sway
        along to the spacy sound in the night and who knows, maybe you will be
        there when the call is finally answered?
