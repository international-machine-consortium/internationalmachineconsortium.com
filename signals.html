      <h2 class="neon-green-text">Techno Giants From Sector 5</h2>
      <p>
        They came in giant saucers<br />
        one sunny Tuesday morning.<br />
        The sound was loud yet silent<br />
        as they descended from the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the neighborhood stood frozen<br />
        and gazed upon the awesome sight<br />
        as the high-tech metal giants<br />
        were beamed down to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        They spoke with some kind of buzzing noise<br />
        and bursts of electric screech. <br />
        And their mostly purple-ish eyes<br />
        shone like a color out of space
      </p>
      <p>
        With a super sonic frequency<br />
        they hooked up to our brains <br />
        and with a quantum line of code<br />
        they bit into a big piece of our mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the dark of the sun<br />
        they started collecting people.<br />
        Like tiny bugs<br />
        we were picked up one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        They put us in large containers,<br />
        made of some strange and steely glass.<br />
        Like canned food they arranged us<br />
        in perfectly curvy lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I saw the thousand faces<br />
        of people trying to scream,<br />
        but all I could hear was the damp thud<br />
        of desperation against glass.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as the cryo sleep enveloped me<br />
        the stars turned into silver lines.<br />
        And in a flash the high-tech metal giants<br />
        took us back to sector 5.
      </p>

      <h2 class="neon-green-text">Signals</h2>
      <p>
        I hear a signal.<br />
        It’s filled with patterns.<br />
        I see the sequence.<br />
        That’s all that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sixty-three thousand<br />
        of all these pages<br />
        I can’t decipher.<br />
        It would take ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are schematics.<br />
        Some kind of transport<br />
        for just one person,<br />
        which made us consort.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can’t imagine<br />
        what will unravel <br />
        if we complete this<br />
        and make this travel.
      </p>

      <h2 class="neon-green-text">Monster In My Closet</h2>
      <p>
        There's a monster in my closet.<br />
        There's a monster in my closet.<br />
        There's a monster in my closet.<br />
        There's a monster in my closet.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a lover in my pocket.<br />
        There's a lover in my pocket.<br />
        There's a lover in my pocket.<br />
        There's a lover in my pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a monster in my closet.<br />
        There's a monster in my closet.<br />
        There's a monster in my closet.<br />
        There's a monster in my closet.

      <h2 class="neon-green-text">Time Crystals</h2>
      <p>
        Let's fall down to zero degrees.<br />
        Enter the state where you surely will freeze.<br />
        You'll surely freeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two magnetic clouds that rotate constantly.<br />
        Sending signals invisibly.<br />
        Invisibly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oscillating crystals in our memories.<br />
        Breaking time translation symmetry.<br />
        You'll break us free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Utilizing both states simultaneously.<br />
        Computations made with quantum theory.<br />
        Our theories.
